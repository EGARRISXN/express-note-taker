# Express Note Taker

_Initially created in the spring of 2023 for my UCF Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp._

## Description

This simple, yet powerful note taking application will help keep your mind on track throughout the day. I used express for my server, local json files to store my data, and heroku for deployment.
